# Stockaid
This is an alpha version, and a python library that helps you fetch and wrangle
data for marketable securities. You will likely want to do ML things. There is
a start at documentation in the docs/source folder, although it is incomplete.
The code snippets are not showing in github's preview, so view the docs raw for
now.

## Install
`python3 -m pip install stockaid`
